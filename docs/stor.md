## Notes on Microservices and RAG

### Why Microservices?

1.	**Scalability**: Microservices architecture allows different parts of the application to scale independently. For example, if the demand for image processing increases, only the image processing microservice needs to be scaled up, without affecting other parts of the application. This ensures efficient resource utilization and cost management.
2.	**Flexibility**: Each microservice can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently. This modular approach means that different teams can work on different microservices simultaneously, leading to faster development cycles and easier integration of new features or updates.
3.	**Resilience**: Microservices improve the resilience of the application. If one microservice fails, it does not bring down the entire system. Other microservices can continue to function, ensuring that the application remains available and operational, which is critical for maintaining user trust and satisfaction.


### Why RAG?
1.	**Minimizes Hallucinations**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) significantly reduces the problem of hallucinations in generated text. By leveraging a retrieval mechanism to pull in relevant documents or information before generating a response, RAG ensures that the generated descriptions are grounded in actual data. This is crucial for maintaining accuracy and trustworthiness in item descriptions.

2.	**Enhanced Data Communication**: RAG allows models to essentially communicate with data repositories. This means that users can input queries or item images, and the model can fetch the most relevant information from a knowledge base or vector database before generating a coherent and contextually accurate description. This approach enhances the quality and relevance of the generated content.
