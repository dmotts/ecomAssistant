Keyword text file examples can be seen in the `keywords` directory. To obtain the lists, CharGPT-4o was prompted for a keywords list. An example prompt:

Give me a common and diverse set of items you would typically find on eBay such as these:
Watch
Technology
Cars
Games
Shoes
Clothes

I am prompting a datascraper to search these items and collect there data for model training. Extend the list above with as many items as you deem necessary for a diverse model training dataset. Format your response as newline seperated item keywords like above.
