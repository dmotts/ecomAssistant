The Mesh Cooling Towel utilizes a thinner, comfy, and amazingly breathable design to keep you cool! So to all you golfers, runners, hikers, and more: beat the heat anytime with YELLOW-PRICE!\nWHY MESH? - It\u2019s soft, comfortable, and light on the skin. What\u2019s more, our built in evaporative technology keeps the cloth colder longer than the rest. Best of all, our \u201cdry-soft\u201d mesh design makes it easy to fold down, and a snap to pack away.\nINSTANT & LONG-LASTING COOLING EFFECT - Instantly activate the cooling towel when you wet it, wring it out, and wave it in the air. This creates a funnel of air and rapidly evaporating water molecules throughout the fabric. When water evaporates it gets very cold, so you stay very cool. Simply re-wet it to reactivate it. The cooling effect can last up to 3 hours, based on your environment.\nFASHIONABLE, COMFORTABLE, MULTI-FUNCTIONAL - The knitted microfiber composite material is soft to touch and attractive to wear. The cooling towel is 40\"x12\", which is perfect size to wear as a light-weight headband, arm wrap, or neck scarf.\nSAFE & ECO-FRIENDLY - Each cooling towel has a 50 UPF rating to keep you protected for long hours in the sun. It can help with hot flashes, relaxing the nerves, and accelerating recovery. We do not waste material with bulky packaging and there are no chemicals or harmful products used in the manufacturing process.\nEXTRA LONG & MULTIPURPOSE SPORTS TOWEL - 40\" long by 12\" wide. It is easy to tie if you will be moving around a lot. Works like a charm as golf club head cover, cooling bandana or neck wrap. Longer inches make the towel perfect for athletes, runners, sports fans into workout, gym and fitness, females suffering with side effects of heat stress, hot flashes; patients who need cold therapy after operations, surgeries; gardeners doing yard work, mowing the lawn and workers working out in summer heat\nSIMPLE TO USE \u2013 It\u2019s easy: soak, wring out, give it a quick \u201csnap\u201d with a flick of the wrist, and enjoy! When it\u2019s about staying cool and beating the heat, nothing beats our fantastic Mesh Cooling Towel. Better still, it comes with it\u2019s very own carry pouch for easy transport.\nNO WORRIES \u2013 We stand firmly by our product with YELLOW-PRICE logo printed on our cooling towel\nHow to use:\nsimply \"wet it\" , \"wing it\" and \"snap it\"\nwhen the towel is wet, it will be extremely cooler than the outside air, thereby providing cooling effect\nwhen it starts to dry out after using, simply re-wet, re-wing and snap it.\nwet it with ice water to further enchance the cooling effect.\nPackage Include:\n2 x Cool towel blue\nPAYMENT\nSHIPPING\nReturn and Refund Policy\nFEEDBACK\nHelp - Customer Support - Contac\nWe accept payment via PayPal.

H.265 offers such impressive compression by expanding the pattern comparison and difference-coding,\nimproving motion vector prediction and motion region merging, and incorporating an additional filtering step called\nsample-adaptive offset filtering.\nMotion Detection\nAfter enable the motion detection and setting the area. Whenever a motion is detected, the camera will trigger alerts by\nimmediately pushing notifications to your device. Also sending alert e-mails. Note:\n\u00b7 Create specific motion detecting zones to monitor certain areas\n\u00b7 Adjust motion detection sensitivity to reduce false alerts.\n               Remote Access in Multiple Devices\nEasy remote viewing on iPhone, iPad, Android devices and PC.

Everything will be the same as the original, firmware, function etc.\n The IR Megapixel Vari-focal Bullet camera delivers 4MP resolutionwith a motorized 2.7mm \u2013 13.5mm varifocal lens. The camera's elegant blend of aesthetics combinedwith a range of easy mounting solutions provides an excellent choice for a variety of small to mid-size applications at an\naffordable price.\nTrue Day/Night\nA day/night mechanical IR cut filter makes this camera ideal for applications with fluctuating lighting conditions, delivering color images during the day and automatically switching to monochrome as the scene darkens\nRegions of interest\nRegions of Interest (ROI) is a user defined feature that allows the operator to monitor specific areas of a scene while still maintaining overall situational awareness of less important areas\nSmart IR\nWith IR illumination, detailed images can be captured in low light or total darkness. The camera's SmartIR technology adjuststo the intensity of camera'sinfrared LEDsto compensate for the distance of an object.Smart IR technology prevents IR LEDS from whiting out images as they come closer to the camera. The camera'sintegrated infrared illumination provides high performancein extreme low-light environments up to 60m(197ft).\nWide Dynamic Range\nEmbedded with industry leading wide dynamic range (WDR) technology,vivid pictures are achieved even in the most intense contrast lighting conditions. For applications with both bright and low lighting conditions that change quickly, True WDR (120dB) optimizes both the bright and dark areas of a scene at the same time to provide usable video.\nImage flip\nCapturing unnecessary data such as surrounding hallway walls can increase storage requirements without any added value. The image flip feature allows the camera's image to be rotated in 90\u00b0 increments for better video optimization.\nProtection\nSupporting \u00b110% input voltage tolerance, this camera suits even the most unstable conditions for outdoor applications. Its 6KV lightning rating provides protectection againstthe camera anditsstructure from the effects oflightning.\nInteroperability\nThe camera conforms to the ONVIF (Open Network Video Interface Forum) specifications, ensuring interoperability between network video products regardless of manufacturer\nHEVC (H.265)\nH.265 ITU-T VCEG is a new video coding standard.

The actual output power will be affected by factors such as sunlight intensity, weather condition, temperature, installation angle, and other inferences. Therefore, to get higher output power, try to use it under strong sunlight, adjust the appropriate angle and avoid shadows.\n Q2: What can this 120W solar panel charge?\nThe output voltage of this solar panel is 20V. It can charge a series of power stations, and other power stations with input voltage equal or over 20V.(So to avoid unnecessary damage, please must check the input voltage range of your power station before use.)\n Q3: Is the solar panel waterproof?\nIt has IP65 waterproof rating, protecting the solar panel from splashing water. The zippered pocket at the back can cover the power port. (Since the junction box is not waterproof, do not expose it to rain for a long time or soak in water.)\n Q4: Why I only get 50-60w from the 120W solar panel?\n1) Firstly ,please check the maximum input power limitation of your power station. For example, if the max input power of your power station is 60w, even if you use a 120W solar panel to charge it, you can only get max 60W from it.\n2) Secondly, please check the factors that can affect the charging efficiency of solar panel in Question 1.\n  Model QC3\nCurrent Type AC\nSystem Configuration Grid-Tie\nPower Source Solar\nType Solar Panel\nFeatures Foldable, Portable\nPower 120W\nBrand LVYUAN\nApplication Agriculture/Farming, Automotive, Back-up Power, Camping/Hiking, Electronics, Home/Garden, Marine\nCharging Mode MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking)\nResistance Properties Abrasion Resistant, Waterproof\nSolar Technology Amorphous (Thin-Film)\nVoltage x\nCurrent Output x\nCurrent Rating x\nMPN x\nPliability Flexible\nCertificate CE,FCC,ROHS\nVOLT AT PMAT (VMP\uff09 20v\nCURRENT AT PMAX (IMP) 6A\nOPEN-CIRCUIT VOLTAGE (VOC) 23.6V\nSHORT-CIRCUIT CURRENT (ISC) 6.6A\nDIMENSIONS (mm) 1675*548\nFOLDED DIMENSION(mm) 548*380*45\nNET WEIGHT(KG) 4.6"}

The focuser simply moves the attached device inwards or outwards while maintaining its orientation, which means your field of potential guide stars will not rotate as focus is adjusted, further increasing ease of use.\n10mm Helical Focuser\nAfter focusing, you can see details of the image clearer and brighter. The focusing accuracy is up to 0.1 mm. The 10 mm focusing stroke will meet your needs for viewing guides.\nM42*0.75 & 1.25inches\nThe Multi-Use Guide Scope features male T-threads on the focuser collar for secure threaded attachment of guide cameras equipped with female T-threads.\nAnd the versatile Guide Scope can double as a straight-through finder scope with an optional 1.25\" eyepiece installed. For example, insert a 20 mm eyepiece to create a 9.5x50 finder scope, or insert one Illuminated Centering Eyepieces for use as a finder with illuminated crosshairs for easy aiming. (Eyepieces sold separately).  \nDouble-sided FMC\nFully Multi-coated Glass means multiple coatings on all lens surfaces and all air-to-glass surfaces are anti-reflective multi-layer coated. And FMC lens has greater advantages in increasing the light transmission, delivering bright, clears and crisps images even in low-light conditions. \nStray Lights Elimination\nThe elimination design improves the observation efficiency since less light is lost due to reflection and improves the contrast of the image by elimination of stray light.\nMetal Hoop with Dovetail\nThe Multi-Use Guide Scope features a machined, knurled metal hoop to make fine focus adjustments nice and easy, while a thumbscrew lets you lock-down the focuser in-place once to complete adjustments. And the plastic on the endpoint keeps the scope itself free of pesky scratches.\nPackage includes:\n1* 50mm/60mm Primary Mirror\n1* Guiding Bracket with Dovetail Plate\n1*1.25 inch Helical Focuser\n6* Metal Thumbscrew"}
