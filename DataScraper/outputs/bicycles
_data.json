The actual output power will be affected by factors such as sunlight intensity, weather condition, temperature, installation angle, and other inferences. Therefore, to get higher output power, try to use it under strong sunlight, adjust the appropriate angle and avoid shadows.\n Q2: What can this 120W solar panel charge?\nThe output voltage of this solar panel is 20V. It can charge a series of power stations, and other power stations with input voltage equal or over 20V.(So to avoid unnecessary damage, please must check the input voltage range of your power station before use.)\n Q3: Is the solar panel waterproof?\nIt has IP65 waterproof rating, protecting the solar panel from splashing water. The zippered pocket at the back can cover the power port. (Since the junction box is not waterproof, do not expose it to rain for a long time or soak in water.)\n Q4: Why I only get 50-60w from the 120W solar panel?\n1) Firstly ,please check the maximum input power limitation of your power station. For example, if the max input power of your power station is 60w, even if you use a 120W solar panel to charge it, you can only get max 60W from it.\n2) Secondly, please check the factors that can affect the charging efficiency of solar panel in Question 1.\n  Model QC3\nCurrent Type AC\nSystem Configuration Grid-Tie\nPower Source Solar\nType Solar Panel\nFeatures Foldable, Portable\nPower 120W\nBrand LVYUAN\nApplication Agriculture/Farming, Automotive, Back-up Power, Camping/Hiking, Electronics, Home/Garden, Marine\nCharging Mode MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking)\nResistance Properties Abrasion Resistant, Waterproof\nSolar Technology Amorphous (Thin-Film)\nVoltage x\nCurrent Output x\nCurrent Rating x\nMPN x\nPliability Flexible\nCertificate CE,FCC,ROHS\nVOLT AT PMAT (VMP\uff09 20v\nCURRENT AT PMAX (IMP) 6A\nOPEN-CIRCUIT VOLTAGE (VOC) 23.6V\nSHORT-CIRCUIT CURRENT (ISC) 6.6A\nDIMENSIONS (mm) 1675*548\nFOLDED DIMENSION(mm) 548*380*45\nNET WEIGHT(KG) 4.6"}
