The camera's elegant blend of aesthetics combinedwith a range of easy mounting solutions provides an excellent choice for a variety of small to mid-size applications at an\naffordable price.\nTrue Day/Night\nA day/night mechanical IR cut filter makes this camera ideal for applications with fluctuating lighting conditions, delivering color images during the day and automatically switching to monochrome as the scene darkens\nRegions of interest\nRegions of Interest (ROI) is a user defined feature that allows the operator to monitor specific areas of a scene while still maintaining overall situational awareness of less important areas\nSmart IR\nWith IR illumination, detailed images can be captured in low light or total darkness. The camera's SmartIR technology adjuststo the intensity of camera'sinfrared LEDsto compensate for the distance of an object.Smart IR technology prevents IR LEDS from whiting out images as they come closer to the camera. The camera'sintegrated infrared illumination provides high performancein extreme low-light environments up to 60m(197ft).\nWide Dynamic Range\nEmbedded with industry leading wide dynamic range (WDR) technology,vivid pictures are achieved even in the most intense contrast lighting conditions. For applications with both bright and low lighting conditions that change quickly, True WDR (120dB) optimizes both the bright and dark areas of a scene at the same time to provide usable video.\nImage flip\nCapturing unnecessary data such as surrounding hallway walls can increase storage requirements without any added value. The image flip feature allows the camera's image to be rotated in 90\u00b0 increments for better video optimization.\nProtection\nSupporting \u00b110% input voltage tolerance, this camera suits even the most unstable conditions for outdoor applications. Its 6KV lightning rating provides protectection againstthe camera anditsstructure from the effects oflightning.\nInteroperability\nThe camera conforms to the ONVIF (Open Network Video Interface Forum) specifications, ensuring interoperability between network video products regardless of manufacturer\nHEVC (H.265)\nH.265 ITU-T VCEG is a new video coding standard.

Besides, it is also suited for those to pick up more details about planets.as well as casual terrestrial,viewing wildlife, scenery;\nExtra-low Dispersion Glass: S-FPL51\nED(Extra-low Dispersion) S-FPL51 is built in SV503 astronomical telescope. ED glass minimizes the effects of the secondary spectrum and reduces chromatic aberration to a remarkable degree. The high-quality 2-Element objective provides sharp and high-contrast images for travel and mobile use.\nUltra-wideband Super Multi-coated\nUltra-wideband super multi-coated is claimed as a remarkable seven-layer lens coating process that cuts the reflection ratio down to just 0.2% per lens surface. The result is a dramatic improvement in both color fidelity and brightness and the elimination of flare and ghost images.\nDual-speed Rack and Pinion Focuser\nThe gear ratio of the dual speed 2-inch toothed focuser is 1: 10, which makes it easy to achieve accurate focus. The dual speed focuser can provide two focusing speeds by using a set of co-axial knobs, one for fast focusing and the other for fine focusing.\n90mm Back Focus\nThe 90 mm back focus and 360 degree adjustable focuser are sufficient for your astrophotography needs, allowing perfect framing of your astrophotography. And the 2\" RAP (rack and pinion) focuser holds more-than-5kg heavy photographic accessories safely.\n1.97 Arc-second Resolution\nThe SV503 ED astronomical telescope can reach 1.97 angular seconds to let you see finer details either in astronomy or wildlife viewing.\nComes With a 2\"-1.25\" Adapter\nThe telescope scope focuser comes with a 2 inch to 1.25 inch adapter. So that you could also use all your 1.25 inch accessories with the SV503 telescope.\n  Metal Hoop with Dovetail\nThe SV503 comes standard with adjustable tube rings and dovetail which allows it to attach to most telescope mounts. In addition, there are 1/4 inch threaded holes on the dovetail plate to attach to tripods and M6 holes on top of the tube rings to attach a guide scope.\nSV503 102mm For Nebulae For Nebulae\nSV503 102mm are suited for those in astrophotography who want to observe binaries, compact nebulae, and star clusters.

You need to prepare some accessories for it. Then set up all the accessories with the telescope tube, then do the observation or astrophotography.\n  Q:Only using the SV503 do Moon observation?\nA:I don\u2019t recommend you start astronomy with SV503, you can start to buy a small telescope. That is enough.e.g. sv501p telescope \u3002\nIf you really want to start doing Moon observation or solar observation (you need a solar filter) with the SVBONY sv503, then here are the accessories you need.\nDiagonal\nEyepiece\nFinder scope (if you want one)\nMount (support the telescope & accessories\u2019 weight)\nLike this:\nQ:I want to do some photography with the SV503 ED telescope. because many astronomers own the SV503 telescope is using it do deep space photography.i want to do this too\nA:Of course you can too\uff0cthen you need \nMain photography camera\nPhotography extension tube\nDovetail for connecting finder scope (with screws)\nFinder scope\nGuiding camera (if want one)\n like this\uff1a\nAlso you could connect a Nikon or Canon camera to the telescope tube. \nAccessories needed:\nCanon camera ( Of course)\nCamera adapter\nPhotography extension tube\nLike this :\n  about svbony"}

The focuser simply moves the attached device inwards or outwards while maintaining its orientation, which means your field of potential guide stars will not rotate as focus is adjusted, further increasing ease of use.\n10mm Helical Focuser\nAfter focusing, you can see details of the image clearer and brighter. The focusing accuracy is up to 0.1 mm. The 10 mm focusing stroke will meet your needs for viewing guides.\nM42*0.75 & 1.25inches\nThe Multi-Use Guide Scope features male T-threads on the focuser collar for secure threaded attachment of guide cameras equipped with female T-threads.\nAnd the versatile Guide Scope can double as a straight-through finder scope with an optional 1.25\" eyepiece installed. For example, insert a 20 mm eyepiece to create a 9.5x50 finder scope, or insert one Illuminated Centering Eyepieces for use as a finder with illuminated crosshairs for easy aiming. (Eyepieces sold separately).  \nDouble-sided FMC\nFully Multi-coated Glass means multiple coatings on all lens surfaces and all air-to-glass surfaces are anti-reflective multi-layer coated. And FMC lens has greater advantages in increasing the light transmission, delivering bright, clears and crisps images even in low-light conditions. \nStray Lights Elimination\nThe elimination design improves the observation efficiency since less light is lost due to reflection and improves the contrast of the image by elimination of stray light.\nMetal Hoop with Dovetail\nThe Multi-Use Guide Scope features a machined, knurled metal hoop to make fine focus adjustments nice and easy, while a thumbscrew lets you lock-down the focuser in-place once to complete adjustments. And the plastic on the endpoint keeps the scope itself free of pesky scratches.\nPackage includes:\n1* 50mm/60mm Primary Mirror\n1* Guiding Bracket with Dovetail Plate\n1*1.25 inch Helical Focuser\n6* Metal Thumbscrew"}
