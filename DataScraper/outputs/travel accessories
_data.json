Besides, it is also suited for those to pick up more details about planets.as well as casual terrestrial,viewing wildlife, scenery;\nExtra-low Dispersion Glass: S-FPL51\nED(Extra-low Dispersion) S-FPL51 is built in SV503 astronomical telescope. ED glass minimizes the effects of the secondary spectrum and reduces chromatic aberration to a remarkable degree. The high-quality 2-Element objective provides sharp and high-contrast images for travel and mobile use.\nUltra-wideband Super Multi-coated\nUltra-wideband super multi-coated is claimed as a remarkable seven-layer lens coating process that cuts the reflection ratio down to just 0.2% per lens surface. The result is a dramatic improvement in both color fidelity and brightness and the elimination of flare and ghost images.\nDual-speed Rack and Pinion Focuser\nThe gear ratio of the dual speed 2-inch toothed focuser is 1: 10, which makes it easy to achieve accurate focus. The dual speed focuser can provide two focusing speeds by using a set of co-axial knobs, one for fast focusing and the other for fine focusing.\n90mm Back Focus\nThe 90 mm back focus and 360 degree adjustable focuser are sufficient for your astrophotography needs, allowing perfect framing of your astrophotography. And the 2\" RAP (rack and pinion) focuser holds more-than-5kg heavy photographic accessories safely.\n1.97 Arc-second Resolution\nThe SV503 ED astronomical telescope can reach 1.97 angular seconds to let you see finer details either in astronomy or wildlife viewing.\nComes With a 2\"-1.25\" Adapter\nThe telescope scope focuser comes with a 2 inch to 1.25 inch adapter. So that you could also use all your 1.25 inch accessories with the SV503 telescope.\n  Metal Hoop with Dovetail\nThe SV503 comes standard with adjustable tube rings and dovetail which allows it to attach to most telescope mounts. In addition, there are 1/4 inch threaded holes on the dovetail plate to attach to tripods and M6 holes on top of the tube rings to attach a guide scope.\nSV503 102mm For Nebulae For Nebulae\nSV503 102mm are suited for those in astrophotography who want to observe binaries, compact nebulae, and star clusters. Besides, it is also suited for those to pick up more details about planets.\nCNC Machined Technology\nGood touch feeling and durable.\n                  \n      102ED Review\nPaul Capino\nMy version of the Horse Head and NGC2023 nebulae, taken from my balcony\nSvbony 102ED + SV106 50mm guide scope\nASI533 + Optolong L Extreme + EQM35M Pro + 1.6hr total integration time + a fat moon\n    Paul Capino\nPickering's triangle as taken last Sept 17th.\nTotal of 1.6hrs worth of 120 sec exposures.\nSvbony SV503 102mm + Svbony SV106 50mm guide scope\nASI533mc pro + EQM35Mpro\n    Jason Jacks \nSv503 102ed and asi2600mc\nThe close ups were through an Svbony 5x barlow.\n  Jason Jacks\nSv503 102ed, astro tech at2ff flattener, IDAS NBZ duo narrowband filter, and asi2600mc pro camera.

You need to prepare some accessories for it. Then set up all the accessories with the telescope tube, then do the observation or astrophotography.\n  Q:Only using the SV503 do Moon observation?\nA:I don\u2019t recommend you start astronomy with SV503, you can start to buy a small telescope. That is enough.e.g. sv501p telescope \u3002\nIf you really want to start doing Moon observation or solar observation (you need a solar filter) with the SVBONY sv503, then here are the accessories you need.\nDiagonal\nEyepiece\nFinder scope (if you want one)\nMount (support the telescope & accessories\u2019 weight)\nLike this:\nQ:I want to do some photography with the SV503 ED telescope. because many astronomers own the SV503 telescope is using it do deep space photography.i want to do this too\nA:Of course you can too\uff0cthen you need \nMain photography camera\nPhotography extension tube\nDovetail for connecting finder scope (with screws)\nFinder scope\nGuiding camera (if want one)\n like this\uff1a\nAlso you could connect a Nikon or Canon camera to the telescope tube. \nAccessories needed:\nCanon camera ( Of course)\nCamera adapter\nPhotography extension tube\nLike this :\n  about svbony"}
