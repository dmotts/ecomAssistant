He began searching for the very best sources of rough diamonds, from Bombay to Israel to Belgium, faceting and polishing the stones himself. Soon, he had a following of loyal customers, and a business was born!\n\nThe company grew, and our grandfather opened offices in the heart of New York City\u2019s \u201cDiamond District.\u201d He passed down his keen eye and dedicated work ethic to his sons, who joined the business and expanded into manufacturing and selling finished jewelry, with diamonds still the focus.\n\nFast forward to today! We, the founder\u2019s grandchildren, are stepping into the family business over 5 decades after it all began. With training in gemology and apprenticeships in jewelry manufacture, we are dedicated to carrying our grandfather\u2019s legacy of artisanship forward into the future.\n\nWe are proud to bring you our fine jewelry collections. Every stone is meticulously chosen, and expertly cut and polished to bring you the optimal balance of breathtaking sparkle and superb value. Our jewelry is carefully designed, and made by hand, by real people \u2013 skilled artisans who have polished their craft over a lifetime, who are valued employees who have been with our company for decades.\n\nBrilliant pieces at no additional mark-up, we hope to introduce you to that fine jewelry piece that will be passed on in your family for decades to come. Jewels are forever \u2013 trust us, we know!"}
