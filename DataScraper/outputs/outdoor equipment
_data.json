Focus on a small area in astonishing detail thanks to the 4X optical zoom or survey a larger scene\nfor maximum coverage.\n                             Human Vehicle Classification\nBuilt-in microphone\nYou can clearly hear outside the door even when you are indoors.\nIP67 Waterproof\nThe camera subjected to rigorous dust and water immersion tests and certified to the IP67 Ingress Protection rating\nmakes it suitable for demanding outdoor applications.\nHigh Efficiency Video Coding (H.265)\nThe H.265 (ITU-T VCEG) video compression standard offers double the data compression ratio at the same level of\nvideo quality, or substantially improved video quality at the same bit rate, as compared to older video compression\ntechnologies. H.265 offers such impressive compression by expanding the pattern comparison and difference-coding,\nimproving motion vector prediction and motion region merging, and incorporating an additional filtering step called\nsample-adaptive offset filtering.\nMotion Detection\nAfter enable the motion detection and setting the area. Whenever a motion is detected, the camera will trigger alerts by\nimmediately pushing notifications to your device. Also sending alert e-mails. Note:\n\u00b7 Create specific motion detecting zones to monitor certain areas\n\u00b7 Adjust motion detection sensitivity to reduce false alerts.\n               Remote Access in Multiple Devices\nEasy remote viewing on iPhone, iPad, Android devices and PC. You can access the camera through the APP. Get live\nstreaming and other control through multiply ways, protect your home and business.\n \u2605Tips:\n> Dahua APP : iDmss( iOS), gDmss( Android), Smartpass\n> Search Tool\uff1aConfig Tool \uff08search device and change IP address if needed\uff09\n> Default IP\uff1a192.168.1.108\n> Camera lens: 2.8mm\n> NVR Channel:16CH 16POE\n> NVR is Dahua original NVR with Dahua logo, support firmware upgrade.\n> The IP Camera is OEM by Dahua, without Dahua logo and box is in general yellow box. Everything will be the same as the original, firmware, function etc.\n The IR Megapixel Vari-focal Bullet camera delivers 4MP resolutionwith a motorized 2.7mm \u2013 13.5mm varifocal lens. The camera's elegant blend of aesthetics combinedwith a range of easy mounting solutions provides an excellent choice for a variety of small to mid-size applications at an\naffordable price.\nTrue Day/Night\nA day/night mechanical IR cut filter makes this camera ideal for applications with fluctuating lighting conditions, delivering color images during the day and automatically switching to monochrome as the scene darkens\nRegions of interest\nRegions of Interest (ROI) is a user defined feature that allows the operator to monitor specific areas of a scene while still maintaining overall situational awareness of less important areas\nSmart IR\nWith IR illumination, detailed images can be captured in low light or total darkness. The camera's SmartIR technology adjuststo the intensity of camera'sinfrared LEDsto compensate for the distance of an object.Smart IR technology prevents IR LEDS from whiting out images as they come closer to the camera. The camera'sintegrated infrared illumination provides high performancein extreme low-light environments up to 60m(197ft).\nWide Dynamic Range\nEmbedded with industry leading wide dynamic range (WDR) technology,vivid pictures are achieved even in the most intense contrast lighting conditions. For applications with both bright and low lighting conditions that change quickly, True WDR (120dB) optimizes both the bright and dark areas of a scene at the same time to provide usable video.\nImage flip\nCapturing unnecessary data such as surrounding hallway walls can increase storage requirements without any added value. The image flip feature allows the camera's image to be rotated in 90\u00b0 increments for better video optimization.\nProtection\nSupporting \u00b110% input voltage tolerance, this camera suits even the most unstable conditions for outdoor applications. Its 6KV lightning rating provides protectection againstthe camera anditsstructure from the effects oflightning.\nInteroperability\nThe camera conforms to the ONVIF (Open Network Video Interface Forum) specifications, ensuring interoperability between network video products regardless of manufacturer\nHEVC (H.265)\nH.265 ITU-T VCEG is a new video coding standard. H.265 Following standard developed around the existing video coding standard H.264, some retain the original technology, while some of the relevant technology to improve the new technology uses advanced technology to improve the relationship between the code stream , encoding quality,and the delay between algorithm complexity , optimize settings specific contentsinclude : Improve compressionefficiency , improve the robustness and error recovery capabilities,real-time to reduce the delay,reduce channel acquisition time and a random access delay , reduce complexity ,etc\nOEM IPC-HFW2431R-ZS/VD-2FR41-ZS  \n4 Megapixel high resolution (2688\u00d71520)  2.7~13.5mm Motorized Varifocal Lens, Auto Focus , 5X Optical Zoom \n\u25b6  Support Smart IVS Detection, Tripwire, Intrusion, Motion Detection\n\u25b6  Up to 197ft Smart IR Night Vision , High performance anti-light infrared light,Day/Night(ICR)\n\u25b6  Support Smart H.265+, H.265&H.264 codecH.265&H.264 codec\n\u25b6  120dB Wide Dynamnic Range, 3D Digital Noise Reduction, Backlight Compensation, 3 video streams\n\u25b6  Rugged all aluminum alloy Case, Outdoor weather protection level of IP67 prevents failure in inclement weather\n\u25b6  Support mobile phone APP remote access,Supported Smart Phone, iPhone, iPad, Android,Window PC\n\u25b6  128GB Micro SD Card Slot\n\u25b6  Multiple network monitoring , Web viewer, CMS(DSS/PSS) & DMSS\n\u25b6  Max IR LEDs Length 60m\n\u25b6  IP67, PoE\nCamera\nImage Sensor   1/3\u201d 4Megapixel progressive CMOS\nEffective Pixels   2688(H)x1520(V)\nRAM/ROM   512MB/32MB\nScanning System   Progressive\nElectronic Shutter Speed   Auto/Manual 1/3\u20131/100000 s\nMinimum Illumination   0.03Lux/F1.4( Color,1/3s,30IRE), 0.3Lux/F1.4( Color,1/30s,30IRE), 0Lux/F1.4(IR on)\nS/N Ratio   More than 50dB\nIR Distance   Distance up to 60m(197ft)\nIR On/Off Control   Auto/ Manual\nIR LEDs  4\nLens\nLens Type   Motorized(ZS),Manual(VFS)\nMount Type   Board in\nFocal Length   2.7mm~13.5mm\nMax.
