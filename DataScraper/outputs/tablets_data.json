Battery matching must be performed to clear original electric quantity insufficiency information and prevent the related control module from detecting false information. If the related control module detects false information, it will invalidate some electric auxiliary functions, such as automatic start&stop function, sunroof without one-key trigger function, power window without automatic function.\nb) Battery monitoring sensor. Battery matching is performed to re-match the control module and motoring sensor to detect battery electric quantity use information more accurately, which can avoid the instrument panel displaying false information.\nBrake Pad Replacement:\n1.If the brake pad wears the brake pad sense line, the brake pad sense line sends a signal sense line to the on-board computer to replace the brake pad. After replacing the brake pad, you must reset the brake pad. Otherwise, the car alarms.\n2.Reset must be performed in the following cases:\na) The brake pad and brake pad wear sensor are replaced.\nb) The brake pad indicator lamp is on.\nc) The brake pad sensor circuit is short, which is recovered.\nd) The servo motor is replaced.\nAnti-theft Matching:\n1.To prevent the car being used by unauthorized keys, the anti-theft key matching function must be performed so that the immobilizer control system on the car identifies and authorizes remote control keys to normally use the car.\n2.When the ignition switch key, ignition switch, combined instrument panel, ECU, BCM, or remote control battery is replaced, anti-theft key matching must be performed.\nDPF Regeneration:\n1.DPF regeneration is used to regularly clear PM (particulate matter) from the trap in combustion oxidation mode (such as high temperature heating combustion, fuel additive or catalyst reduce PM fire point combustion) to stabilize trap performance.\n2.DPF regeneration matching must be performed in the following cases:\na) The bleeding backpressure sensor is replaced.\nb) The PM trap is removed or replaced.\nc) The fuel additive injector is removed or replaced.\nd) The catalytic oxygenizer is removed or replaced.\ne) The DPF regeneration MIL is on and maintenance is performed.\nf) The DPF regeneration control module is replaced.\nOdometer Calibration:\n1.Instrument panel mileage calibration is used to copy, write, or rewrite mileages. That is, use the car diagnostic computer and data line to copy, write, or rewrite chip data on the instrument panel to make the instrument panel display actual mileages.\n2.Usually, when the vehicle speed sensor is damaged or the mileage is incorrect due to instrument panel faults, you must perform mileage calibration after maintenance.\nAdblue Reset:\nAfter the diesel exhaust gas treatment fluid (automobile urea) is replaced or filled up, the urea reset operation is required.\nTire Pressure Reset:\n1.After the tire pressure MIL turns on and maintenance is performed, the tire pressure resetting function must be performed to reset tire pressure and turn off the tire pressure MIL.\n2.Tire pressure resetting must be performed after maintenance is performed in the following cases: tire pressure is too low, tire leaks, tire pressure monitoring device is replaced or installed, tire is replaced, tire pressure sensor is damaged, tire is replaced for the car with tire pressure monitoring function\nService Lamp Reset:\n1.If the service lamp is on, you must provide service for the car.
