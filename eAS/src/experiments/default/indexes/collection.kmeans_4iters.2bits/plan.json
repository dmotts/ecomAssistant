                "JPT 30W 50W 60W 100W Fiber Laser Marking Engraving Metal Machine Rotary Axis PS:Welcome contact us for more details of this fiber machine! JPT M7 series high power pulsed fiber lasers make use of master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) configuration, and show excellent laser performance as well as high level of temporal pulse shaping controllability. As compared to the Q-switching technology, the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and pulse width can be controlled independently in MOPA configuration, through adjusting different combination of the above parameters, the peak power of laser can be well maintained. And enable JPT laser suitable for more material processing which Q-switch limited. The higher output power makes its advantages especially in high speed marking applications. Technical Parameters Item Value Application Laser Marking Laser Power 60W Brand Of Fiber Laser Module JPT laser source Lift Span Of Fiber Laser Module 100,000 hours Light Beam Quality M2<1.5 Marking Line Speed \u22648000mm\/s Minimum Line Width 0.012mm Minimum Character 0.15mm\/Depends on the material Marking Depth \u22641.2mm\/Adjustable depends on the materials Repeating Precision \u00b10.003mm Focus Spot Diameter <0.01mm Output Power Of Laser 10%~100% continuously to be adjusted Laser Wavelength 1064nm Power Supply AC220V\/50Hz Temperature \/Humidity 15\u2103~35\u2103\/10%~95% Power Consumption \u2264400W Operating System Win XP\/Win7\/Win8\/Win10 Marking Format Graphics,AI,Text, PLT, DXF, BMP, Dst, Dwg, LAS, DXP,Bar code, QR code etc. Laser Type Fiber Laser Condition New Cooling System Inbuilt air cooling Communication Standard USB2.0 Control Software Ezcad (Easy To Use) Place of Origin China Certification CE, ISO Laser Source Brand JPT Control System Brand BJJCZ (Original version) Gross Weight (KG) 55KG Net Weight (KG) 45KG Package Carton box Key Selling Points Easy to operate Rotary Axis Optional After Warranty Service Video technical support, Online support, Spare parts Marking Area 300mm*300mm\/175*175mm Machinery Test Report Provided Video Outgoing-Inspection Provided Warranty of core components 2 years Core Components Motor, bearing, gear, pump, laser source, lens, galvanometer, control board Optional (Not For Free) Rotary device,moving table,other customized automation This above parameters are laboratory test results,subject to actual operating conditions.
