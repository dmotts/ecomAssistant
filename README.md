  <p align="center">
    eAS is a tool that generates aggregated item pricing and descriptions by simply inputing an item's name. It uses ColBERT for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, eBay’s RESTful APIs for knowledge base acquisition, and Docker for microservice orchestration.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

This project aims to streamline the listing process by providing high-quality, autogenerated item pricing and descriptions using a RAG model scheme. This not only saves time for sellers but also ensures that listings are detailed, price-appropriate, and appealing to potential buyers.

### Limitations
Access to an eBay production keyset is not yet possible. As a consequence, the dataset created for this project had to be crafted from items on eBay's Sandbox Environment (using a sandbox key for API calls). This hinders the program's ability to retrieve useful outputs in most situations. Firstly, because Sandbox Environment mostly consists of low-quality test item postings. Secondly, because of the small quantity of postings, a dataset of only around 1,500 unique items could be collected. With that aside, this project showcases that if given a production keyset to scrape high-quality data (around 20,000 diverse listings would be needed), the program would be able to carry out its goals. More details about this are noted in `DataScraper/README.md`

### Method

1. **Developing the Knowledge Base**: 
  - Data Collection: Knowledge base developed with eBay data scraper scripts. (See the `DataScraper` directory for details.)
  - Data Organization: Organized the knowledge base into a collection of documents (strings) for ColBERT’s Indexer. (See the `RAG` directory containing the `DataCollator` class for details.)
  - Data Indexing: Used ColBERT’s Indexer to process and index the collection, making it searchable. 
    - This was done on Google Colab as GPU support is needed for indexing. See the `ColBERT_eAS_Indexing.ipynb` notebook for specifics on the indexing process.
    - The index files can be saved and used later with the Searcher in a dedicated retrieval script.

2. **Executing the Retrieval Query**: 
  - Query Processing: Once the collection is indexed, ColBERT’s Searcher can take a query and compare it to the indexed documents to find the k best matches.
  - User Query Input: The user inputs a descriptive title for the item they wish to sell, which the Searcher uses to find relevant documents.

3. **Aggregating Price Data**:
  - Document Retrieval: ColBERT retrieves documents based on the text query (the item’s title), providing information about the k most similar items scraped from eBay.
  - Price Calculation: Extract the price attribute from each of the k documents, and calculate an aggregated price value to suggest to the user for their product.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
Instructions for simple local setup and run are given below. If you would like to see details on how to setup virtual environments for testing, that information is available in the 'RAG' and 'DataScraper' directories.

### Prerequisites
- Download Docker Desktop [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

### Installation
- Create a directory for this program, and clone this repo into it:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rfeinberg3/eBayAutoSeller.git
cd eBayAutoSeller
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Main Program
- Use the provided shell script for super simple start-up.
```sh
sh run.sh
```
- Or run the commands yourself to initialize containers in the background and attach to the main app container.
```sh
docker compose up --build --detach
docker attach ebayautoseller-retrieval-1
docker compose down
```

### eBay DataScraping
_For details on how the dataset for retrieval was created, or how to recreate it for yourself, please refer to the [DataScraper Directory](https://github.com/rfeinberg3/eBayAutoSeller/tree/main/DataScraper). Setup is super easy!_

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Demo
Loading the program takes around 1 minute. Once loaded query retrieval is almost instant! Control + C to exit the program. (This destroys all the containers.)

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Build a Knowledge base using eBay's RESTful API calls to scrape item data based on keywords.
  - [x] Use Selenium Chrome Drivers to extract item descriptions buried in html and js.
- [x] Research and test retrieval model to integrate into this program.
- [x] Create a dataset builder to format data to ColBERT for indexing and retrieval.
    - [x] Index on colab.
    - [x] Create CPU functional retrieval script.
- [x] Create Dockerfiles for each microservice.
- [x] Orchestrate containers with docker compose and shell scripts (deploy ready).
- [ ] Refactor all code into classes with abstracts where applicable
- [ ] Add Typing to all classes.
- [x] Refactor main README.
- [ ] Full Stack Paradigm.
  - [ ] Write frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and React potentially) and push to cloud server.
  - [ ] Refactor this repo into a dedicated backend with Flask API calls, Gunicorn, and a cloud provider.
  - [ ] Convert the `Dataset` directory into a dedicated Database (PostgreSQL). 
- [ ] Integrate feature to scrape custom item data from eBay, given a user's keyword query.
  - [ ] Dynamically update the database when this is used.
- [ ] Research, test, and integrate a generative model to use with this program for item description generation.


See the [open issues](https://github.com/rfeinberg3/eBayAutoSeller/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
