# eBay_Auto_Seller

## Project Overview

eBay_Auto_Seller is a tool designed to generate descriptions for images of items that users would like to sell or resell on eBay. Leveraging eBay's extensive API support, this project aims to streamline the listing process by providing high-quality, autogenerated item descriptions. This not only saves time for sellers but also ensures that listings are detailed and appealing to potential buyers.

### Key Aspects
- **Microservice Architecture**: Using Docker-compose to orchestrate containerization.
- **REST APIs**: Scalable and efficient API calls.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Fast and size efficient document retrieval to text generation.
- **Data-pipeline**: Knowledge base, vector database, and query handling development.

## Why Choose eBay

With numerous e-commerce websites available, why choose eBay? While it may not be everyone's favorite e-commerce platform, I believe eBay is the best choice for this application for several important reasons.

1. **Open-Source API Support:** eBay is the most well-known e-commerce website that supports open-source RESTful API calls. Although more popular services like Facebook Marketplace and OfferUp exist, they donâ€™t offer public APIs.

2. **Extensive Developer Support:** eBay has extensive developer support, evident through consistent updates, maintenance, and community engagement events. This robust support ensures a reliable and up-to-date API service.

3. **Vast and High-Quality Data:** eBay provides a vast quantity and quality of data, superior to other e-commerce sites like Etsy or Shopify. High-quality data is crucial for training a model to generate descriptions of everyday items people may wish to resell. Unlike Shopify and Etsy, which cater more to entrepreneurial startups, eBay's data is well-suited for this purpose.

## Why RAG?

- Significantly fights against "hallucinations".
- Allows for users of RAG based models to essentially communicate with data repositories.
